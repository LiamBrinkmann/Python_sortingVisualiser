# Python_sortingVisualiser

# A Python GUI used to visualise:
* # Bubble sort
* # Quick sort 
* # Merge Sort

The GUI itself was built using Tkinter, this meant i could not implement multithreading, as far as i know tkinter does not play nice with threading.  
As such users should not try and click items while the sorting is taking place.  
Please lower your volume first, i made use of winsounds to play some beeps as the sorting takes place, but at a louder volume they can be unpleasant.
